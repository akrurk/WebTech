        <p>Hello, I’m Akrur Kamal Khetan. Currently, I’m a junior at Babson College and I’ve made this website as part of my Web Technologies course at Babson. I’m from Mumbai, India.</p>

        <p>As you can tell, this website is about different localities within Mumbai, and some of the best real estate projects in the city. I have had extensive experience in the real estate world, as my family business involves development of both commercial and residential properties throughout the city.</p>
            
        <p>Being brought up in a family business, I was always interested in learning more about real estate. While I know much about my own family business, during the course of this website’s development, I got the opportunity to research about other real estate projects throughout the city from the other major real estate developers throughout the city.</p>
            
        <p>I aspire to one day work for, and takeover my family business after graduating, and this website is the result of my hard work and passion about this industry. It also proved to be a learning opportunity for me, as I got to learn about competitive markets within the city, and major projects.</p>
            
        <p>I am also a Mumbai lover, as I was born and brought up there. I’ve lived here all my life. Through this website, I have tried to show you the city from my eyes, and I hope you like it!</p>
